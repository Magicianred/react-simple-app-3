# Simple Note Taking React App

A simple application that allows you to view and create notes. Written with React, Webpack and Babel. Special thanks to the service [Yandex Abstracts](https://yandex.ru/referats/) for generate meaningless, but cool text snippets.

The project build is located in the `/dist` folder. Works correctly in all modern browsers.
